## AutoresizeMask-for-Xcode

Simple xCode plugin to visualize view autoresizing if it's set from code

![Settings Window](https://raw.github.com/garnett/AutoresizeMask-for-Xcode/master/example.png)

## Installation

Simply build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins. To uninstall, just remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).

This is tested on OS X 10.8 with Xcode  4.5.

## Usage

Just set the cursor to line with mask code: the popup showing spring and struts will be displayed. You can enable/disable plugin in Edit menu ("Show autoresizing masks" option).
